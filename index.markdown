Software engineer based in France with three years of experience in development of UI and 3D application, I am seeking a remote position in which I could further enhance my expertise.

Accustomed to working in small teams, I have contributed to projects ranging from small prototypes to industrial applications, gaining experience in various technical environments, including automated testing and embedded software, while tackling challenges such as latency constraints.

I recently followed a training in React, and I am improving this new skill through a side project.

Outside of programming, I enjoy dancing, going to the gym, and building with Lego bricks :)
